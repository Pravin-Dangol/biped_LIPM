**Full_sim.m** - simulates hybrid zero dynamics, for a specified number of steps or until failure

**Optimize_params.m** - optimizes z0 and bezier coefficients on zero dynamics

**Test_ZD.m** - used for checking difference of zero dynamics with full dynamics

The rest of the files are functions, aside from the symbolic_derivation/m which is used to get state and impact matrices, control action, and symbolic functions for zero dynamics
